    "---\n",
    "The solutions to Assignment 2 are **due on Jan 24, 2020 (before 3:35PM ET).**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you must work in groups of one or two students. Each person is responsible to write their own code, but the group will (together) discuss their solution.  In this notebook, we provide you with basic functions for completing the assignment.  *Complete the assignment in this notebook.  You will need to modify existing code and write new code to find a solution*.  Each member of the group must upload their own work (i.e., a notebook file) to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes, you can find the solutions online, but why looking for a solution if you can find it by brainstorming with your peers and challenging yourself? Try not to look for a solution at least until the end of this lecture. Unleash your imagination, build a network of peers by finding your own solution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running a cell will not rerun previous cells.  If you edit code in previous cells, you must rerun those cells.  We recommend using* `Run All` to avoid any errors results from not rerunning previous cells.  You can find this in the menu above:* `Cell -> Run All`\n",
    "\n",
    "- When solving a programming problem such as Problems 1-3 below, it is generally a bad idea to try and optimize your program in your first attempt. Rather than implementing clever algorithms right away, it is better to write a simple script that you are certain will work and is easier to debug. Once your script runs correctly (possibly with smaller input than the final problem you wish to solve), commit your working solution to your GitHub repository, then you can think about how to improve it."

    "## Problem 1:\n",
    "(From [ProjectEuler Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).) If we list the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get: 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a function that finds the sum of the multiples of $p$ or $q$ below $N$. \n",

    "#### Assumptions and constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that $1 \\leq p < q < N$ and that each of these values are integers. Your code should be able to (a) handle values of $N$ up to at least 100,000,000 and (b) terminate in less than 1 second.\n",

    "- There are two general approaches to this problem, the naïve (slower) approach and a more mathematical (faster) approach involving the [inclusion-exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle). To meet the performance constraints, you will have to implement the fast approach.\n",
    "- There are different approaching to measure execution times (wall-clock times). The approach below is one of them. Use what you prefer, as long as you measure wall clock time."
